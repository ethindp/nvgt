# opPreDec
Atomically decrements the current value. The operation is a read-modify-write operation. Specifically, performs atomic pre-decrement. Equivalent to `return fetch_sub(1) - 1;`.

```nvgt
T opPreDec();
```

## Remarks: 
This operator is only available on integral atomic types.

Within the above function signature, `T` is used as a placeholder for the actual type. For example, if this object is an `atomic_int`, then `T` SHALL be `int`.

Unlike most pre-decrement operators, the pre-decrement operators for atomic types do not return a reference to the modified object. They return a copy of the stored value instead.
