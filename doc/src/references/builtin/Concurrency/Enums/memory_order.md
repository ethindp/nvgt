# `memory_order`
Specifies the constraints on the ordering and visibility of memory operations (reads and writes) in concurrent programming, determining how operations on shared memory are observed across different threads.

| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_ORDER_RELAXED` | An atomic operation with `MEMORY_ORDER_RELAXED` has no synchronization or ordering constraints beyond those imposed by the atomicity of the operation itself. It guarantees that the operation on the atomic variable is atomic and modifications to that variable are visible in some modification order consistent across threads, but it does not impose any inter-thread ordering constraints or create happens-before relationships. |
| `MEMORY_ORDER_ACQUIRE` | An atomic operation with `MEMORY_ORDER_ACQUIRE` on an atomic variable synchronizes with a release operation on the same variable from another thread. It ensures that all memory writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable become visible in the current thread before any subsequent memory operations (following the acquire operation) are performed. This establishes a happens-before relationship from the release to the acquire. |
| `MEMORY_ORDER_RELEASE` | An atomic operation with `MEMORY_ORDER_RELEASE` ensures that all preceding memory operations in the current thread are completed before the release operation is performed. It makes the effects of these prior operations visible to other threads that perform an acquire operation on the same atomic variable. The release operation synchronizes with an acquire operation on the same variable, establishing a happens-before relationship. |
| `MEMORY_ORDER_ACQ_REL` | An atomic operation with `MEMORY_ORDER_ACQ_REL` combines both acquire and release semantics. For operations that modify the atomic variable (read-modify-write operations), it ensures that all preceding memory operations in the current thread are completed before the operation (release semantics), and that all subsequent memory operations are not started until after the operation (acquire semantics). This enforces that the operation synchronizes with other acquire or release operations on the same variable, establishing happens-before relationships in both directions. |
| `MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST` | An atomic operation with `MEMORY_ORDER_SEQ_CST` (sequential consistency) provides the strongest ordering guarantees. It ensures that all sequentially consistent operations appear to occur in a single total order that is consistent with the program order in all threads. This total order is interleaved with the program order such that each read sees the last write to that variable according to this order. It combines the effects of acquire and release semantics and enforces a global order of operations, establishing a strict happens-before relationship. |
