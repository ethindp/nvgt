# set_interfaces
Sets the list of interfaces that will receive touch events.

`bool set_touch_interfaces(touch_interface@[]@ interfaces, bool append = false);`

## Arguments:
* `touch_interface@[]@ interfaces`: A list of interfaces that will receive touch events.
* `bool append = false`: Determines whether to append to the list of existing interfaces Vs. replacing it.

## Returns:

bool: True if a change was made to the interface list, false otherwise.

## Remarks:
You can pass multiple interfaces to a gesture manager because different interfaces can receive different events for various parts of the screen. An interface can simply return false in it's `is_bounds` method at any time to pass the gesture event to the next handler in the chain. Gesture interfaces are evaluated from newest to oldest.
