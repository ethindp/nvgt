## Does this thing work?
Since the plan is for this website to remain super simple, the decision has been made to create it using the Cobalt static site generator.

If more advanced features are added to this website, we can simply plop more directories in the webroot than what Cobalt generates.

This is just a test to make sure all is working, and I guess to denote the creation date of nvgt.gg or something.
